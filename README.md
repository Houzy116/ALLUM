# Satellites Reveal Recent Increases in Global Land Surface Albedo that Moderate Global Warming

This repository contains the code and some intermediate data for the study titled **"Satellites reveal recent increases in global land surface albedo that moderate global warming"**. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains intermediate data used in the study.
- **figure/**: Stores generated figures. These figures can be recreated using the scripts in the repository.
- **preprocess/**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing.
- **grid_data/**: Includes scripts for generating grid data in ALLUM.
- **val/**: Contains scripts for data validation.
- **anasys/**: Contains scripts for analysis.
- **tool.py**: A script that includes common utility functions and variables used across the repository.

The data in pink boxes and yellow boxes separately represent 500m-resolution pixel-level data and grid-level data.</em>
